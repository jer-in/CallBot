### 🧠 What is CallBot?

**CallBot** is an experimental quality-of-life software tool that lets an AI assistant **make phone calls on your behalf** — for things like booking appointments, lodging complaints, or anything you’d rather not do yourself.

> Built out of curiosity. No deadline. Just a mission to reduce awkward phone calls. 😅

## 🚧 Current Status

This repo is a **work-in-progress**. So far, we’ve implemented:

- ✅ A public **landing page** (React + Tailwind)
- ✅ Dark/light mode support
- ✅ Visual signup form (for collecting interest)
- 🛠️ Code hosted in the `/WebPage` directory

---

## 🧠 Project Vision

CallBot aims to:
- Use **natural language understanding (NLU)** to interpret user intent
- Use an AI voice interface to **call businesses or people** on the user’s behalf
- Summarize the call results and **log interactions**
- Be useful for introverts, anxious callers, and automation nerds alike
